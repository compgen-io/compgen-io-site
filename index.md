# Welcome

compgen.io is the home for a series of tools for computational genomics (next-generation sequencing analysis). Many of these tools came from programs written to support specific in-house analysis efforts. They are offered here as a resource for others to use and adapt for their own projects and workflows.

Please [let us know](/contact) if you find any of these tools useful or if you have questions!
