# swalign
[Github](https://github.com/mbreese/swalign)

swalign is a version of a standard Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm written in Python. It is a useful
example of how one might write an aligner from scratch. Even though it is not highly optimized, it is widely
used as a teaching tool or for quick alignment searches when building an index would be overkill.

The aligner can be used in a stand-alone mode or as an importable Python library.
